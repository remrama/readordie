Replace the filename with the date of your blog post and the title you prefer (note to use dashes instead of spaces).

Replace everything in the header above _except for the `layout` part_. That should always stay as `post`. The `tags` part can be left off, but if you want to add relevant tags to your post for easier lookup/grouping later, add them as a list with tags separated by commas, for example: `[rsfMRI,sleep]`. You can also leave off the `article_doi`, which will only turn your blog title to a link hyperlink directed there.

Here are a few sentences for another paragraph. Leave a space between paragraphs, otherwise it will be attached to the previous one. Try it out yourself and see what it looks like. Add as many sentences as you would like. **This part is bold** and _this part is italicized_. Okay.

Here we can make a list
1. of
2. numbered
3. things.

* or a list
* that is
* un-numbered.

It's easy to include links in your text. All you do is put brackets around the [site you want to link to](https://github.com/remrama/readordie) and then the link following in parentheses.

Lastly, images can be useful. There are [multiple ways](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images) to insert images. My personal prefer is the one below using html syntax because you can center them.

    This text will show up as a caption to the image.
